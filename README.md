# advixe-cl-completion
tab completion for the advixe-cl

From [The Intel Developer Forum](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-vtune-amplifier-xe/topic/564262)
I got the impression that no tab completion for `advixe-cl` exists at the moment. (And also I didn't find one
on google). So I start here a completion for zsh.

The completion function is provided "as is". At the time of writing, the functionality is far from complete,
I do not aim for long term maintenance. I will update the parts I use as needed, but expect regressions.

Contributions are welcome.

This may be other shells (e.g. fish, bash), bug fixes, additions of missing functions.

Intel is explicitly invited to pick up on the work done here to ship a completion definition with future releases
of advixe-cl.

At the current status, the contributors are not affiliated to Intel.
